Dota 2 Fixups currently provides the following fixes for issues that occur when attempting to run a Dota 2 server.

* Fix clients receiving an error message when manually connecting to servers (due to not bringing lobby data with them).
* Fix third-party dedicated servers shutting down shortly after startup.
* Fix waiting for players stage being skipped.
* Enable existing dota_local_custom_* convars for dedicated servers for easier custom addon support.
