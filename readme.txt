Dota 2 Fixups currently provides fixes for the following issues that occur when attempting to run a Dota 2 server.

* Clients receive an error when manually connecting due to not bringing lobby data with them.
* Running dedicated Dota 2 server (using Alien Swarm's srcds.exe, for example) will shut itself down shortly after startup.
* Waiting for players stage being skipped.
